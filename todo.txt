- Set properties to float registers

- Rename pseudos to aliases?
  - A pseudo can expand to multiple instructions, but aliases can't

- rsp named control registers
- verify rsp named registers

- Consider making `const` functions that access `static` data.
  - con: It would raise the MSRV

- Change `is_jumptable_jump` to return the register too.
  - Will need to be renamed to avoid the `is_` part, probably

- Split operand immediate into signed/unsigned.

- Get rid of get_processed_rsp_offset_impl.
