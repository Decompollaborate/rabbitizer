rabbitizer (whole name is lowercase) is a MIPS instruction decoder API.

## Quick example

Check the [Rust-specific README](src/rabbitizer/README.md) for examples of the
Rust API.

`rab-disasmdis` is a an example program that allows decoding hex words on your
terminal. Check out [its README](src/rab-disasmdis/README.md).

`rab-disasmdis-web` contains the code for running a static website for decoding
and encoding MIPS instructions. It gets compiled to WASM, so no webserver is
needed. Check out [its README](src/rab-disasmdis-web/README.md).

## Features

- Simple per-word instruction decoding.
  - The library doesn't try to be too smart by processing multiple instructions
    at a time, neither trying to handle endianness.
- Can perform validation checks for decoded instructions.
  - For example, it can check if a given instruction has garbage data on bits
    where the it should contain zeroes.
- Provides many examination/grouping functions for instructions, allowing to
  simplify checking characteristics of an instruction and minimizing the need to
  check for specific instructions in a hardcoded way.
  - i.e. Check for `.does_link()` instead of checking for `jal`, `jalr`, `bal`
    `bltzal`, etc.
- Configurable, many features can be turned on and off.
- MIPS instructions features:
  - Support for ABI register names: o32, n32, o64, n64, eabi32 and eabi64.
    - You can also turn off ABI names and use numeric names for registers if
      preferred.
  - Configurable behavior for the `jalr` instruction, allowing to disassemble
    the instruction using an implicit or explicit `rd` register depending if
    that register is `$ra` or not.
  - Named registers for MIPS VR4300's coprocessors.
  - Support for many pseudo-instructions.
    - Pseudo-instruction detection can be turned off per pseudo.
- Some workarounds for some specific compilers/assemblers:
  - `SN64`: `div`/`divu` fix: tweaks a bit the produced `div`, `divu` and
    `break` instructions.
  - `gccee`: Many workarounds for R5900EE specific instructions to support the
    differences between the original toolchain and modern gas.
- Multiple MIPS ISAs versions and ISA extensions are supported:
  - MIPS I, II and III ISAs.
    - Partial support for MIPS IV too.
  - N64 RSP instruction support.
    - RSP decoding has been tested to build back to matching assemblies with [armips](https://github.com/Kingcom/armips/).
  - R3000 GTE (PSX's CPU) support.
  - R4000 ALLEGREX (PSP's CPU) support.
  - R5900 EE (PS2's Emotion Engine processor) support.
  - Which ISA version/extension pair is used to decode an instruction can be
    selected at runtime.
  - ISAs are "feature gated", so you can only pay for what you use.
    - This may not be configurable if using a language binding other than the
      native Rust API.
- Includes an experimental instruction encoder, allowing to "assemble" MIPS asm
  instructions back to their hex representation.
  - This is not an assembler. Most of the features supported by an assembler
    are completely missing, without any plans to support them.
  - The supported syntax is pretty restrictive, only supporting the syntax
    emitted by the rabbitizer's decoder.
  - Explicit relocations are not supported.

### Planned features

- Bindings for other programming languages, so you can unleash rabbitizer's
  power on your prefered language.
  - Python bindings
  - C bindings.
  - C++ bindings

## Non-features

In order to keep it simple the following features will never be supported:

- Pseudo-instructions which expands to more than one instruction.

## Installation

rabbitizer is available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/rabbitizer) and
can be included in your Cargo enabled project like this:

```toml
[dependencies]
rabbitizer = "2.0.0-alpha.7"
```

For more details and feature configuration, consult the
[Rust-specific README](src/rabbitizer/README.md#installation).

<!--
### Python bindings

The recommended way to install is using from the PyPi release, via `pip`:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -U rabbitizer
```

If you use a `requirements.txt` file in your repository, then you can add this
library with the following line:

```txt
rabbitizer>=1.12.0,<2.0.0
```

### Development version

The unstable development version is located at the
[develop](https://github.com/Decompollaborate/rabbitizer/tree/develop)
branch. PRs should be made into that branch instead of the main one.

Note that building the Python bindings from source require the Python
development package. Under Ubuntu/Debian based distros it can be installed with:

```bash
apt install python3-dev
```

In case you want to mess with the latest development version without wanting to
clone the repository, then you could use the following command:

```bash
python3 -m pip uninstall rabbitizer
python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/Decompollaborate/rabbitizer.git@develop
```

NOTE: Installing the development version is not recommended. Proceed at your own
risk.

See this package at <https://pypi.org/project/rabbitizer/>.

### Rust bindings

Add this crate to your project with Cargo:

```bash
cargo add rabbitizer
```

Or you can add it manually to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
rabbitizer = "1.12.0"
```

See this crate at <https://crates.io/crates/rabbitizer>.
