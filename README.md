MIPS instruction decoder API.

## Features

- Should produce matching assembly.
- Fully written in C for fast decoding.
  - The library is completely allocation-less, in other words `rabbitizer`
  doesn't allocate in anything in the heap by itself.
- Other language bindings supported in this repo:
  - Python bindings
    - The minimal Python version is 3.7, older versions are not guaranteed to work.
  - C++ bindings
  - Rust bindings
- Simple per-word instruction decoding.
  - The library doesn't try to be too smart by processing multiple instructions
  at a time.
- Can perform validation checks for instructions.
- Provides many examination/grouping functions for instructions, allowing to
  simplify checking characteristics of an instruction and minimizing the need to
  check for specific instructions in a hardcoded way.
- Includes some minor tools to build your own pointer/symbol detection.
- Configurable, many features can be turned on and off.
- MIPS instructions features:
  - Named registers for MIPS VR4300's coprocessors.
  - Support for many pseudo-instructions.
  - Properly handle move to/from coprocessor instructions.
  - Support for numeric, o32, n32 and n64 ABI register names.
- Some workarounds for some specific compilers/assemblers:
  - `SN64`:
    - `div`/`divu` fix: tweaks a bit the produced `div`, `divu` and `break` instructions.
- Multiple MIPS architectures are supported:
  - Main focus on MIPS I, II and III architectures. Partial support for MIPS IV too.
  - N64 RSP instruction decoding support.
    - RSP decoding has been tested to build back to matching assemblies with [armips](https://github.com/Kingcom/armips/).
  - R5900 (PS2's Emotion Engine processor) decoding support.

## Non-features

In order to keep it simple and fast the following features will not be added:

- Pseudo-instructions which expands to more than one instruction.

## Installing

### Python bindings

The recommended way to install is using from the PyPi release, via `pip`:

```bash
pip install rabbitizer
```

In case you want to mess with the latest development version without wanting to
clone the repository, then you could use the following command:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Decompollaborate/rabbitizer.git@develop
```

NOTE: Installing the development version is not recommended. Proceed at your own
risk.

See this package at <https://pypi.org/project/rabbitizer/>.

### Rust bindings

Add this crate to your `Cargo.toml` via:

```toml
[build]
rabbitizer = "1.5.8"
```

See this crate at <https://crates.io/crates/rabbitizer>.
